            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a seasoned Biomedical Science professional with over eight years experience in both routine and integrated 
                diagnostic services. Coming from a very technical and analytical background, I have developed a passion for technology
                and automated systems over the years. I also have an aptitude for picking up new skills quickly and applying them. 
                This stems from my ability to pay keen attention to details and knowing precisely when to ask for help. I intend to 
                combine my tech skills with my knowledge of medical systems to improve and solve diagnostic problems using technology

                When I am not working, I engage in intelligent conversions and bants on random topics with friends. I also play soccer on my 
                free weekends.
